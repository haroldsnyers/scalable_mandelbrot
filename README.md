# scalable_mandelbrot

A mandelbrot generator written in go to demonstrate architecture scalibality, horizontal and vertical. 

## What does it consist of ?
- a single thread mandelbrot generator
- a multi thread mandelbrot generator
- a multi manchines mandelbrot generator

### Single Thread Mandelbrot
This go script simply compute the mandelbrot on a single thread 

### Multi Thread Mandelbrot (vertical scalibility)
This go script makes use of goroutines to compute the mandelbrot. The mandelbrot generating works in pixels such as to generate an iamge of a certain width and height. This means that the width equals the number of columns. That being said, the mandelbrot is generated by having a goroutine for each column. 

### Multi Machines Mandelbrot (horizontal scalibitity)
This part had two main steps. First we developped a system with a master and multiple slaves. The hardcoded, the master knows how many slaves are running and will divide the mandelbrot generation in the number of slaves that are available. The computation is thus done by the slaves which all run as http servers. When they are done calculating, the return the encoded bytes of de mandelbrot specific part that they have generated and the master script combines these arrays of bytes to generate the final image of the mandelbrot. 

The second step was to migrate these script in docker images to simulate a horizontal scalibility. This would keep the same structure of master and slaves except that we would have an additional player, a kind proxy. The slaves (servers) register to the proxy. Then when the client or master wants to generate a mandelbrot, it will first make a request for the servers that are up. Depending on the result, it will divide the work in the number of connected servers and start the generation of the mandelbrot.
